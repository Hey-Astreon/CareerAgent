## 🛡️ 7. Core Non-Negotiable Operational Rules

1. **Zero Database Corruption:** Never wipe `dev.db`. All schema alterations must use `npx prisma db push --skip-generate` or verified migration files.
2. **Commit Identity:** Always author Git commits as `Hey-Astreon <playboxstation460@gmail.com>`.
3. **Proactive Validation:** Always verify with `npm run build` and `npx vitest run` before marking tasks complete.
4. **Founder Protocol Override:** Respond with immediate full memory restoration upon receiving **Code 9926**.
